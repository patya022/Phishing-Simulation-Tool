    <h2>How to Identify Phishing Emails:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Check the Sender:</strong> Look carefully at the sender's email address. Phishing emails often use addresses that look similar to legitimate ones but are slightly altered.</li>
        <li><strong>Suspicious Links:</strong> Hover over any links without clicking on them to see where they lead. Phishing emails often direct you to fake websites.</li>
        <li><strong>Grammar and Spelling:</strong> Many phishing emails contain unusual grammar or spelling errors.</li>
        <li><strong>Urgency:</strong> Phishing emails often try to create a sense of urgency or fear, asking you to act immediately.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What to Do Next:</h3>
    <p>If you think you've encountered a phishing email, <strong>do not click on any links or provide your credentials</strong>. Report it to your IT department or the email provider.</p>
